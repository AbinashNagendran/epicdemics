A comparative analysis between the SEIR model and other traditional ML-based time series models for dengue outbreak prediction

To enhance public health decision-making, vaccine distribution, and early intervention strategies while establishing a scalable framework for forecasting infectious diseases
Brazil is facing the most severe dengue epidemic in its history, with over one million cases and 304 deaths in 2025 already. The co-circulation of multiple virus serotypes, rapid urbanization, and rising temperatures driven by climate change have intensified the threat, stretching public health systems beyond capacity. 

While the Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model is commonly used for outbreak prediction, it assumes fixed disease spread patterns, treats all infected individuals the same, and fails to account for testing limitations, behavioral changes, and policy interventions, making it less reliable.

So how will a traditional ML model pair against one that is specific to predicting cases?
